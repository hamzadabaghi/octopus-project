This project consists to develop a web application for the management of oncology multidisciplinary consultation meetings (RCP) for the ORL department.

The project proposes a semi-automatic oncology decision-making tool that aims to increase clinicians’ performance in the MDM's case management.

We’ve designed an intelligent interface that could allow an oncology team consultation framework with flexible time management and a better case/time review quality, also, it automatically selects complex cases for conventional MDMs meetings which yield a better-quality discussion.

Used Technologies : Laravel , PHP , HTML , CSS , JS , JQuery , MYSQL , BOOTSTRAP .
